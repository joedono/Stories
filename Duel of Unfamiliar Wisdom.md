# The Duel of Unfamiliar Wisdom
Two wizards, one academically trained and the other self-taught, meet on their first day of employment at a magical library.

## Theme
We can all learn from each other, no matter our origins.

## Characters
* Elias - a high born wizard who recently graduated from a prestigious wizarding academy
* Thomas - a talented, but completely self-taught, wizard

## Summary
Elias and Thomas are both working on their final requirement for earning their wizarding licenses. A large farm outside of the city is having crop failures. Some black mold is spreading through the crops and preventing their growth. Elias and Thomas start their investigation but have wildly different ideas on the approach, cause, and solution to the problem. It turns out that the problem is a grengelle, a sort of fungus monster that makes a nest underground and devours living plants through their roots. Elias recognizes the creature first. His first attempt at cleansing the monster also results in the death of the crops. Thomas knows of another method that leaves the crops unharmed, but will only drive the monster away, possibly to another farm. Elias and Thomas have a duel on the farm that disturbs the grengelle enough for it to come to the surface in the night, forcing the two of them to improvise. Elias realizes his solution will work now without damaging the crops, but he's missing a key ingredient. Thomas realizes he brought a valid substitute. With their combined knowledge, the two wizards manage a spell that puts the grengelle down for good. It's oozing corpse isn't directly good for the crops, but it serves extremely well as a deterrent for other pests.

## Story
Elias cursed under his breath as his traveling boot made a squelching noise as he stepped out of his carriage. He wasn't sure what he had managed to step in, and he didn't much care to know. As far as Elias was concerned, it was just one more reason to hate the countryside. The driver chuckled softly. Elias gave the driver a weary look, and the driver quickly attempted to cover his laugh by coughing. "'ere we are, sir! The proud town of Lamb's Fields. Will dat be all 'dere, sir?" the driver asked.

Elias sighed. As far as he was concerned, Lamb's Fields had about as much of a right to call itself a "town" as an anthill did. "I don't suppose you would know where a gentleman could find himself a bath, would you?" Elias asked.

"What's a... baff?"

Elias rolled his eyes. "Nevermind." He wasn't surprised by the driver's lack of hygenic knowledge. The man smelled nearly as bad as Elias' boot. "Can you tell me where the..." Elias checked his journal, "...The Drunken Daisy is? I should have a room reserved there."

"Oh, ay! Best boar's ribs from here to Hazelton. 't's about 2 miles thattaway." He gestured with his riding crop towards the village center. "Big flower on the sign out front. Can' miss it."

"Thank you, my good man." Elias pulled out a gold mark and held it out in his hand. The driver looked puzzled. Elias was at least 10 feet away from him. The driver unhooked his riding belt and started to stand up, when the coin gently rose out of Elias' hand and slowly floated towards the driver. The driver gingerly picked the coin out of the air, as if he expected it to burn his hand. Elias nodded to the driver one last thanks, attempted to scrape the sticky substance off of his boot, and then started down the road towards town. The driver wasn't sure what was more astonishing: that he had just been paid more money than he would make in a year for simply giving directions, or that he had just given rather poor quality transportation to a scorching Wizard of the Academy.

Thomas breathed deep as he crested the final hill. His traveling pots clinked against his pack as he stopped. He straightened his wide-brimmed hat and looked out over the majestic farms that made up his destination. Lamb's Fields smelled of rich crops, healthy animals, hearty folks, and best of all, opportunity. Thomas was beyond excited. His first *real* assignment! He reached into the inside pocket of his coat and pulled out the carefully folded paper for the thousandth time. "By order of the Academy, assignment is hereby granted to one Thomas Jonathan Whistledune. To facilitate your recognition as an official Wizard in Good Standing, you are ordered to perform the following." There was a gap where the form letter ended and the handwritten portion began. "A plague of unknown origin is ravaging the crops in Lamb's Fields. Locate the source of the contamination and eliminate it, ensuring a plentiful harvest for the autumn. Signed, Thaddeus T. Whitford. Grand Magus of the Academy"

Fresh excitement welled up inside Thomas, and he nearly cried out in joy when he spotted a carriage coming up the road towards him. Thomas quickly stifled his excitement and waved a greeting to the driver. His greeting was not returned, however. Thomas looked at the driver's face. His attention was fixed on something shiney in his hand. Thomas' excitement and joy was replaced with astonishment as he saw that the driver was holding a golden mark. Thomas had never seen one before either. "Ahoy there, sir!" Thomas called, "What impressive service did you perform to earn such a coin?"

The driver looked up at Thomas, plain confusion on his face, "I, er, gave a man directions...."

Thomas panicked slightly. He rifled in his pockets before coming up with three silver marks. "I hope this is enough to buy your service again. I'm looking for The Drunken Daisy."

The driver blinked at Thomas, "Popular place nowadays. Don' ye worry a bit. Yer close. The Daisy ain't but a mile down this road. And don' ye worry about the payment. Directions are 'posed to be free."

Thomas shook his head, "I won't be outdone by another traveler like this. I insist." Thomas held out the silver pieces and blew on them. The coins vanished into wisps of smoke, which streaked towards the carriage driver. The driver shook in his seat as the smoke flowed to the seat next to him, and reformed into the three silver coins. For the second time that day, the driver touched money as if it would burn him. Thomas tipped his hat to the driver and walked past him down the road. The driver looked after him. "Scording wizards.... Somethin' brewin' in Lamb's Fields, aright. Giddy-up, Doris. I 'ave a feelin' we don' want to linger here too long." The driver whipped the reins and started a little more quickly down the road, away from Lamb's Fields.
