# The Duel of Unfamiliar Wisdom
Two wizards, one academically trained and the other self-taught, meet on their first day of employment at a magical library.

## Theme
We can all learn from each other, no matter our origins.

## Characters
* Elias - a high born wizard who recently graduated from a prestigious wizarding academy
* Thomas - a talented, but completely self-taught, wizard

## Summary
Elias and Thomas are both working on their final requirement for earning their wizarding licenses. A large farm outside of the city is having crop failures. Some black mold is spreading through the crops and preventing their growth. Elias and Thomas start their investigation but have wildly different ideas on the approach, cause, and solution to the problem. It turns out that the problem is a grengelle, a sort of fungus monster that makes a nest underground and devours living plants through their roots. Elias recognizes the creature first. His first attempt at cleansing the monster also results in the death of the crops. Thomas knows of another method that leaves the crops unharmed, but will only drive the monster away, possibly to another farm. Elias and Thomas have a duel on the farm that disturbs the grengelle enough for it to come to the surface in the night, forcing the two of them to improvise. Elias realizes his solution will work now without damaging the crops, but he's missing a key ingredient. Thomas realizes he brought a valid substitute. With their combined knowledge, the two wizards manage a spell that puts the grengelle down for good. It's oozing corpse isn't directly good for the crops, but it serves extremely well as a deterrent for other pests.

## Story
Elias cursed under his breath as his traveling boot made a squelching noise. He wasn't sure what he had managed to step in, but as far as Elias was concerned, it was one more reason to hate the countryside.
