## Story
The fire crackled and popped as Valus stoked it. Brisket and Mutt had gathered plenty of firewood for the night. Although a night in the woods was never bitterly cold this time of year, having a fire was still a smart idea when camping out in the wilderness. It kept the bugs and the beasts away and would give Valus' little group light to see by in case they were attacked by something bigger. The woods along the Bear's Path had been peaceful lately, but you never knew when a bandit gang or a family of wyverns would claim these woods as their territory. It paid to be careful. It paid to have fire.

Valus sat back and stared at the fire for a moment before reaching into his pack, pulling out a bottle of ointment and a clean bandage, and looking at Shevar. "Should see to that slash wound."

The muscular woman stared daggers at Valus, "Told you already. It nothing. Just scratch," she grunted.

"If it were just a scratch, ya wouldn't be carrying yer giant sword wit yer lame hand, now wouldja?" Brisket never missed a chance to needle Shevar.

Shevar stood and loomed over the smaller boy, "What you say? I have no lame hand! Both hands good for hunting, carrying... and strangling." The last word hung in the air for a moment. Everyone was on edge after the week they'd had.

The tension was broken by a dull thump. Sebastian had closed his book. Valus braced for the lecture that was sure to follow. Even after learning first hand what a monsterous fighter Shevar was, it was still Sebastian, with his even voice and cold fury, that terrified Valus. Brisket and Shevar paid attention too, their momentary quarrel nearly forgotten. "Tell me something, dear friends of mine. Have tiny spiders crawled into your ears and eaten the memories out of your heads? No? Then perhaps you could explain to me how you could have forgotten the importance of immediate medical attention, a good night's rest, and not fighting your blasted friends." Any other man might have shouted those last words, but Sebastian never raised his voice. It made these little reprimands of his all the more poignant. Brisket and Shevar wilted under the assault. "Now Brisket, apologize to Shevar, then go and find us some food for the night. My rations are running low. And Shevar. Sit down and let Valus tend to your wound. I would hate to be forced to expand your limited vocabulary to include words like 'infection' and 'amputation'" Shevar glanced questioningly at Valus, who made a slicing motion across his shoulder. Shevar frowned and looked at her own shoulder. Her frown morphed into a look of realization before she sat down abruptly and allowed Valus to dress her wound.

"Sorry fer sayin yer hand was lame, Shevar. C'mon, Mutt. Let's find some grub for these 'ere maniacs," Brisket said. The large brown dog yawned, clearly desiring the sweet embrace of sleep, before standing and padding after the young boy to look for food. Satisfied, Sebastian returned to his book.

Valus sighed, then sat down next to Shevar. She unhooked the leather strap holding her shoulder plate in place, exposing a nasty slash wound that had only recently stopped bleeding. In truth, the wound looked far worse than it was. The male amursa didn't have poison in their claws, so there was no worry about that, but the rot could still set in if the wound wasn't seen to. Valus chuckled as he noticed Sebastian burp slightly and turn away. For all of the lad's intelligence and confidence, his constitution could use some work. Valus poured a generous amount of the ointment into the wound, making Shevar wince, then started dressing it with the clean bandage.

"It too bad mother amursa out on hunt when we attack nest, eh?" Shevar asked.

Valus nodded, "Got lucky. She'll be none too happy when she finds her nest wrecked and her mate killed."

"You think she want revenge?"

"Not sure."

Sebastian looked up from his book, "That was our entire reason for only dispatching of her mate. Amursa matriarchs only seek vengenace for the death of their offspring. The death of her mate will cause her to determine that this area is too dangerous to raise offspring, and she will take her young elsewhere. That was the very purpose of our little errand, dear friends."

Shevar flexed the muscle of her good arm, "It bad luck. We smash mother amursa easy! Hahaha!" Shevar's laugh carried through the forest. A cursp answered with it's usual flawless mimicry.

Sebastian actually smiled, "You may be right, my dear barbarian. With our combined capabilities, I daresay we would have emerged victorious, but we did not come here to needlessly cull the wildlife. Amursa may be inconvenient to King Edward's trade routes and army marches, but they still play a vital role in maintaining the circle of life."

Valus finished dressing Shevar's wound. "Would have been nice to see how roast amursa meat tasted when it came from a female though," he mused.

Shevar and Sebastian looked at Valus in shock. The swordsman was always serious, but this was so absurd it could have been mistaken for a joke. "You do recall that female amursa have poison coursing through their veins, yes?" Sebastian asked. Valus only smiled and stoked the fire.

A voice rang out from just beyond the fire, "Tonight, me lords and lady, we dine like the nobles we would 'ave been in another life!" Brisket returned, his arms full of berries, nuts, and several large fruits.

Sebastian gasped, "Where on Hastin did you manage to find mangos?"

Brisket dropped his load on a bedroll and grinned, "I 'ave me ways, my lord." He swept his arms in a flourish and bowed. "Also, Mutt loves the juices," he admitted.

The hound barked, walked over to the pile of food, dug through it with his nose before finding one of the fruit. He picked it up in his mouth, walked over to his customary spot at the foot of Brisket's bedroll, laid down, and started eating. Brisket divided up the nuts and berries into equal shares and passed them to Valus, Shevar, and Sebastian. However, there were only two mangos remaining in the bedroll. Brisket and Sebastian eyed each other.

"Odds?" Brisket asked.

"Evens," Sebastian replied.

They each put their hands behind their backs. Sebastian counted, "One, two... three!" Sebastian threw out his hand, four fingers extended. Brisket held out two fingers. Sebastian managed to contain a whoop of victory as Brisket's face fell. Sebastian picked up one of the mangos and added it to his pile, then began to munch on the nuts as he opened his book again. Shevar looked at Valus. He could see her desperately trying to cover her desire for the sweet fruit. Valus gestured for her to take it. A wide grin appeared on Shevar's face before she almost knocked Brisket down in her lunge to get the mango.

Everyone's needs seen to, Valus finally allowed himself to relax a little. He laid back with his share of food and looked up at the stars. There seemed to be fewer of them tonight, despite the cloudless sky. Brisket brought over his food and reclined on the ground next to Valus.

"Feels good to do a good thing, don't it?" Brisket asked light-heartedly.

"Not sure it was a good thing. King Edward *said* he would use this route to improve spice trade with Elmfast. More likely, he'll use it to move soldiers in and set up watchtowers and checkpoints, force travelers coming this way to pay tolls to enter the kingdom."

"So... ye don't think we did a good thing 'ere?"

"Don't know. Don't usually think about the motivations of kings. King Edward paid us. We got the job done. Simple as that."

"Anyone ever tell ye that yer blasted depressing?"

"All the time. Not sure why."

Sebastian chimed in, "We may have to start revising our impression of you, Valus." Sebastian turned to Brisket, "You missed it. Valus made an attempt at something approximating a joke while you were out foraging."

Brisket exhaggerated his shocked reaction, "Ye don' say? Our Valus, Mister Stoneheart, was funny?"

"I didn't say that," Sebastian said. "He made an attempt. It was anything but funny."

Valus shot Sebastian a sour look as Brisket laughed around the berries in his mouth. Sebastian held his hand out and offered Valus a slice of his mango. Valus took the fruit with a nod of thanks.
