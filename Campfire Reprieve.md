## Story
The fire crackled and popped as Valus stoked it. Brisket and Mutt had gathered plenty of firewood for the night. Although a night in the woods was never cold this time of year, having a fire was still a smart idea when camping out in the wilderness. It kept the bugs and the beasts away and would give Valus' little group light to see by in case they were attacked by something bigger. The woods along the Bear's Path had been peaceful lately, but you never knew when a bandit gang or a family of wyverns would claim these woods as their territory. It paid to be careful. It paid to have fire.

Valus sat back and stared at the fire for a moment before reaching into his pack and pulling out a bottle of ointment and a clean bandage. "Alright, Shevar. Let's see to that stab wound."The muscular woman stared daggers at Valus, "Told you already. It nothing. Just scratch," she grunted. "If it were just a scratch, ya wouldn't be carrying yer giant sword wit yer lame hand, now wouldja?" Brisket never missed a chance to needle Shevar. Shevar stood and loomed over the smaller boy, "What you say? I have no lame hand! Both hands good for hunting, carrying... and strangling." The last word hung in the air for a moment. Everyone was on edge after the week they'd had.

The tension was broken by a dull thump. Sebastian had closed his book. Valus braced for the lecture that was sure to follow. Even after learning first hand what a monsterous fighter Shevar was, it was still Sebastian, with his even voice and cold fury, that terrified Valus. Brisket and Shevar paid attention too, their momentary quarrel nearly forgotten. "Tell me something, dear friends of mine. Have tiny spiders crawled into your ears and eaten the memories out of your heads? No? Then perhaps you could explain to me how you could have forgotten the importance of immediate medical attention, a good night's rest, and not fighting your blasted friends." Any other man might have shouted those last words, but Sebastian never raised his voice. It made these little reprimands of his all the more poignant. Brisket and Shevar wilted under the assault. "Now Brisket, apologize to Shevar, then go and find us some food for the night. My rations are running low. And Shevar. Sit down and let Valus tend to your wound. I would hate to be forced to expand your limited vocabulary to include words like 'infection' and 'amputation'" Shevar glanced questioningly at Valus, who made a slicing motion across his shoulder. Shevar frowned and looked at her own shoulder. Her frown morphed into a look of realization before she sat down abruptly and allowed Valus to dress her wound. "Sorry fer sayin yer hand was lame, Shevar. C'mon, Mutt. Let's find some grub for these 'ere maniacs," Brisket said. The large brown dog yawned, clearly desiring the sweet embrace of sleep, before standing and padding after the young boy to look for food. Satisfied, Sebastian returned to his book.
